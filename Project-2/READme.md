## The folder includes;

   1. Data Foundation Project 2.pdf  -> Presentation slide
   2. DF_Project.xlsm                -> Survey Data
   3. countries.csv                  -> External data
   4. Project2.ipynb                 -> Jupyter notebook file
   5. Project2.html                  -> Jupyter notebook HTML file



 - For the project data cleaning and aggregation starts with excel programming and I used python programming (Pandas and numpy libraries) with Jupyter Notebook.

 - The folder included the Jupyter notebook file (Project2.ipynb) which you can see all my work about the project. The file included more work.

 - Jupyter notebook needs to be download on your computer but if not I included a HTML file version so you can open see the file with HTML. (You cannot run the function)

 - Data visualisation created with [https://plot.ly/][Plotly]. For running the Plotly graphs you need to install the plotly on your device. (Included link for each slides)

 - countries.csv is an external data that include countries langitude and longitude data. The data included for map visualisation but I did not add for this project. (If you want to run ipynb file please keep countries.csv file)


 Thank you
